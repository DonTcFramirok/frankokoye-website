    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mb-8">Posted on: July 2025</p>

    <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-300 text-[17px]">
      <p>They lied to us, they told us, “When you grow up, you will have freedom”. Freedom to do what? Pay exorbitant NEPA bill, Abuja rent, excess billings and cry in traffic? As children, we couldn't wait to become adults. We saw our uncles’ driving cars, drinking Coke without permission, and shouting at PHCN like bosses. Nobody warned us that adulthood is just a never-ending cycle of work, bills, wahala, and whispering “God abeg” every morning.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">1. Bills Are Like Thieves in the Night</h2>
      <p>Electricity bill, water bill, subscription bill, internet, rent, fuel, even apps are billing us. Before you even open your eyes, someone somewhere is deducting ₦1,200 and the worst part? You start calculating money in your sleep: “Okay, if I skip lunch for 3 days, I can afford that data plan…”</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">2. Everything Hurts for No Reason</h2>
      <p>You bend slightly, your back says crack. You sleep the wrong way, your neck goes on strike. You eat beans and now your stomach is negotiating peace with your intestines. Why is adulthood so fragile? You sneeze once and suddenly you need to lie down for 2 hours.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">3. Small Talk, Big Wahala</h2>
      <p>Every time someone asks “So what do you do now”? Your soul leaves your body briefly. Because truth is… you don’t even know anymore. Some days you are a writer, other days you're a consultant, and once in a while, you’re just “between opportunities” and then there is networking: “Let’s grab coffee sometime” …. translation: Let’s pretend to care about each other on LinkedIn.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">4. Cooking Is Now a Chore, not a Vibe</h2>
      <p>Remember when we used to play with pretend cooking sets as kids? Now you enter kitchen, boil rice, fry stew, do small chopping and boom, your back is aching like you just ran a marathon and the dishes? They multiply faster than your responsibilities.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">5. Sleep? Never Heard of Her</h2>
      <p>Kids sleep by 8pm. Adults? We’re up at 2am googling “How to make passive income with no skills”. You want to sleep early, but your brain decides: Let’s relive that embarrassing moment from 2011, let’s calculate how much you've wasted on shawarma this year, let’s worry about rent, remember fuel. For no reason. At 2:48AM.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Conclusion: Where’s the Refund Office?</h2>
      <p>If I knew adulthood came with back pain, stress, and fake smiles at meetings, I would have stayed in nursery school forever, eating crayons and sleeping after lunch. To anyone reading this, if you are adulting and surviving, I’m proud of you. If you are thriving? Teach us your ways, oh wise one and if you’re struggling? Just know you are not alone. We are all winging it.</p>
