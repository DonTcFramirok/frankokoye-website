    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-2">THE TRUTH ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA: A brutally honest love letter to the app that’s draining your battery and your self-esteem</h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mb-8">Posted on: July 2025</p>

    <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-300 text-[17px]">
      <p>Let’s not lie to ourselves, social media has us in a chokehold and not the romantic kind. I mean a full WWE, no-tag-team, figure-four-leg-lock type of grip. We wake up and the first thing we check is not our blood pressure or bank account balance (because we already know the answer to that one). No, we rush to Instagram, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter, formerly sanity) to see if strangers liked the photo of our rice and stew from last night. Spoiler: they didn’t. But that’s okay because we added “#f...

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Welcome to The World of Make-Believe (Wi-Fi Required)</h2>
      <p>Social media is basically Disney World for adults, full of beautiful lies, fake smiles, and filters that can turn a tired goat into a sexy unicorn. Everyone is: “In Dubai” (but they live in Dutse), “Booked and busy” (yet always online), “CEO of My Life” (with no employees, no office, not even a stapler), meanwhile, you are just trying to survive Monday and avoid NEPA’s mood swings.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Influencers: The New Prophets of Nonsense</h2>
      <p>Influencers are the high priests of this new religion. Yesterday, they were doing “how to make puff puff with your air fryer”, today they’re offering “emotional healing courses” for ₦10,000 per head. They tell you: “Drink ginger water every morning, speak to the sun, and block negative energy”, you obey but your rent still remains unblocked. Life is hard.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">The Comment Section: Where Common Sense Goes to Die</h2>
      <p>Ah yes. The comment section, Nigeria’s largest war zone after election season. One person posts a photo of a dog. The comments: “This is why feminism is failing”, “Jesus is coming soon”, “When will Obi win?”, “DM me for forex investment.” How did we get here? From poodle to politics in 2 comments flat. Internet speed is nothing compared to how fast madness spreads online.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">The Filter Olympics</h2>
      <p>Filters are the biggest scam since MMM. One minute, someone looks like Tems, the next minute, in real life, you’re wondering how Tems became Temidayo from Egbeda and it’s not just women, even men are not left out. Bro will use filter, beard filler, whitening cream, and ring light, and suddenly he is looking built with great physic like VDM but meet him in person? Boom!!!! Investor Sabinus or Funnybros.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Social Media Love Is Powered by Delusion</h2>
      <p>He (Especially Gwarimpa men) slides into your DMs like: “Hey queen, you’re the sun in my solar system 🌞”. One week later, he is asking if you have ₦20,000 for fuel. Two weeks later, you’re blocked. Three weeks later, you see him commenting “🔥🔥🔥” on another girl’s post. My sister, I’m sorry. It wasn’t love. It was content.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Clout Is the New Currency</h2>
      <p>Forget CVs. Clout is the new qualification. Someone will say the dumbest thing ever like “The Earth is flat and made of fufu” and boom! 50,000 likes, 20k followers, and an invitation to speak at a youth empowerment summit. Meanwhile, you with your two degrees and NYSC certificate are still sending emails to HR like “Dear Sir/Madam…”</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">But seriously…</h2>
      <p>Despite all the madness, social media has done some good. People have started businesses, reconnected with lost friends, found love (the serious kind, not the DM kind), and even raised money in emergencies. Folks like VDM, Tunde Ednut is using their platform to advance the good of Nigeria and the world at large by standing against injustice.</p>

      <p>But just remember this: Not every smiling photo means happiness, not every “motivational speaker” knows what they’re saying, and not every “travel blogger” bought that flight ticket with their own money (shoutout to sponsors, sugar daddies and mummies)</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Final Words from a Tired Scroller</h2>
      <p>Use social media, but don’t let it use you. Laugh, post, scroll, but don’t compare your real life to someone’s curated highlight reel and please, for the love of mental health, log out sometimes. Eat your rice in peace, not everything must enter Instagram. See you online (but hopefully not in the comment section war zone).</p>
