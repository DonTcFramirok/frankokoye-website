      <p><strong class="text-white">Love is sweet</strong> but wedding planning in Nigeria is a spiritual warfare. Weddings in Nigeria aren’t just events. They are concerts, fashion expos, economic crises, reality shows, spiritual assignments and Instagram content bundles all rolled into one glorious, chaotic celebration.</p>

      <p>If your wedding didn’t: Shut down a street, trend on social media, or cause at least two fights over small chops…… did it even happen?</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">1. Aso Ebi: The Uniform of Peer Pressure</h2>
      <p>If you have not been emotionally blackmailed into buying Aso Ebi at a suspiciously inflated price, are you even Nigerian?...</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">2. Small Chops: The Ultimate Scam</h2>
      <p>You sit under a canopy for 4 crazy hours, clapping for strangers, just to be served a plate containing: One puff-puff, half a samosa...</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">3. Brides Competing Like They’re Running for Senate</h2>
      <p>Every bride wants her wedding to break the internet... They forget that wedding is one day, marriage is for a lifetime...</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">4. In-Laws & the Southern Fundraising Olympics</h2>
      <p>If you are marrying into a Southern Nigerian family, prepare to empty your destiny account... “So you want to marry our daughter for free?”</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">5. EFCC is Watching You</h2>
      <p>You think you are living large. You spray money in slow motion while Fuji plays... now the EFCC is on your neck...</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">6. Men on Post-Wedding Mission</h2>
      <p>Men collecting numbers for after-party “genital meet-and-greet.” While everyone is dancing and throwing petals...</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">7. The Wedding You Can’t Afford</h2>
      <p>Most couples are going broke to impress people they won’t speak to again till their 3rd anniversary...</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Final Thoughts: Weddings vs. Real Life</h2>
      <p>Nigerian weddings are beautiful, loud, rich in culture, and full of vibes — but marriage is what begins after the jollof, not the jollof itself.</p>
