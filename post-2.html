    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mb-8">Posted on: July 2025</p>

    <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-300 text-[17px]">
      <p><strong class="text-white">Love is sweet</strong> but wedding planning in Nigeria is a spiritual warfare. Weddings in Nigeria aren’t just events. They are concerts, fashion expos, economic crises, reality shows, spiritual assignments and Instagram content bundles all rolled into one glorious, chaotic celebration.</p>

      <p>If your wedding didn’t: Shut down a street, trend on social media, or cause at least two fights over small chops…… did it even happen?</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">1. Aso Ebi: The Uniform of Peer Pressure</h2>
      <p>If you have not been emotionally blackmailed into buying Aso Ebi at a suspiciously inflated price, are you even Nigerian? They will say….. “It’s just ₦45,000, and the tailor is fast!” Next thing, you are dressed in glittering discomfort and sweating like a white goat on eke market day waiting for “nna anyi sacrifice” or looking like a background dancer in a Juju music video just so you don’t “fall hand” and God help you if you don’t post a picture. They will DM you. “Ah ah, you didn’t wear it na!!!”</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">2. Small Chops: The Ultimate Scam</h2>
      <p>You sit under a canopy for 4 crazy hours, clapping for strangers, just to be served a plate containing: One puff-puff, half a samosa, a spring roll the size of a cigarette and two toothpicks posing as grilled chicken. By the time you blink, waiters have dodged your table three times….. but you look across the hall and see one table that looks like a buffet in Dubai (Madam waiters family of course). Omo, it is classism in action.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">3. Brides Competing Like They’re Running for Senate</h2>
      <p>Every bride wants her wedding to break the internet. Instagram must see her dress, makeup, drone coverage, LED stage, and 24-hour highlight reel. They want CNN styled coverage of “the most expensive wedding of the decade” (Even when Oga groom no be Obi Cubana). Nobody is talking about the marriage oh. They forget that wedding is one day, marriage is for a lifetime. Your flowers were imported from France but can you effectively communicate without throwing slippers, jabs and hurtful words?</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">4. In-Laws & the Southern Fundraising Olympics</h2>
      <p>If you are marrying into a Southern Nigerian family, prepare to empty your destiny account. They will hit you with….. bride price list of 57 items, including “a white fowl with gentle temperament”, settlement for village youth, cola nuts for the ancestors, transport money for the uncles, money to “break open kuntus gate” (even when the kuntus have already been violated by different men and ex’s). The bride price is a community development levy and if you negotiate too much, they'll say… “So you want to marry our daughter for free?” (Oga sell your daughter nah!!!).</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">5. EFCC is Watching You</h2>
      <p>You think you are living large. You spray money in slow motion while Fuji plays in the background, two weeks later, congrats!!! your video goes viral, and now the EFCC is on your neck like a lace on Aso Oke. “This display of wealth is suspicious,” they say. My brother, you're not an Okoya. Calm down, don’t let vibes land you in court for naira mutilation.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">6. Men on Post-Wedding Mission</h2>
      <p>Let us not ignore the side hustle going on at receptions. Men (married and single alike) discretely collecting numbers for after-party “genital meet-and-greet.” While everyone is dancing and throwing petals, these ones are: Scanning bridesmaids, locking eyes with old flames, sending DM feelers from behind the DJ booth. Later that night, phones will be hot…..  “Hey, I saw you at Emeka’s wedding, you looked radiant…” </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">7. The Wedding You Can’t Afford</h2>
      <p>The sad part? Most couples are going broke to impress people they won’t speak to again till their 3rd anniversary (if they last that long). By the honeymoon, they’re in a hotel room Googling “how to recover from wedding debt” and whispering sweet nothings like…. “Baby, maybe your uncle can lend us transport fare back.” Not forgetting the “Father of the day or sponsor” who most times is a sugar daddy to the bride.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Final Thoughts: Weddings vs. Real Life</h2>
      <p>Nigerian weddings are beautiful, loud, rich in culture, and full of vibes but let’s not forget the actual point: Marriage is not about matching Aso Ebi or spraying bundles. It is about doing life with someone after the music stops and the last plate of jollof is cleared. So while you plan to trend, go viral, or outshine the last cousin that married, also plan for the marriage because after the vendors, photographers, and bridal train have gone home… na you and your partner go dey look each other.</p>
