    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-2">HOW TO PRETEND YOU ARE BUSY WHEN YOU ARE UNEMPLOYED (A MASTERCLASS): Even joblessness must be done with dignity.</h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mb-8">Posted on: July 2025</p>

    <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-300 text-[17px]">
      <p>Let’s be real: unemployment is tough but you know what’s even tougher? Pretending you are booked and busy when you’ve spent the whole day battling the urge to nap for the fifth time. In Nigeria, if you are not looking busy, people assume: you are lazy, you are unserious, or you need deliverance. So let me teach you the art of packaging your joblessness like a LinkedIn CEO.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">1. The Power of Google Calendar</h2>
      <p>Always have your phone open to a calendar. Even if its empty, squint your eyes like you are mentally rearranging global meetings. Say things like: “Let me check my availability…”, “I can squeeze you in after 2pm”. Nobody must know the only thing on your to-do list is “boil water and think about life.”</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">2. Laptop (if you have one) Always Open = Hustle in Progress</h2>
      <p>It doesn’t matter if your laptop is showing the homepage of Netflix or Minesweeper, just keep it open. Better still, scatter some Excel sheets on the screen and press your keyboard aggressively. People will respect you. They don’t need to know you are calculating how long ₦3,500 can sustain you this week. (But why will you have a laptop and be jobless)?</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">3. Step Out in Office Clothes Once a Week</h2>
      <p>Wear a shirt, carry a laptop bag and walk fast. If anyone asks where you're going, say: “Quick meeting on the island or CBD”, It is mostly remote but they like physical check-ins once in a while”. Then go to a café, order bottle water, and log into Twitter to argue about fuel subsidy, APC, PDP, ADC, EPL etc.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">4. Speak Fluent “Remote Work”</h2>
      <p>Never say you are unemployed. Say: “I’m consulting independently for now”, “I’m between contracts”, “Currently freelancing with some startups abroad”. Translation: you're unemployed, but with data. Bonus: Learn buzzwords like “synergy”, “backend pivot”, “market traction” and “scalable deliverables”. Use them randomly in conversations. Nobody will question your hustle.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">5. Schedule Fake Zoom Calls (Yes, it works)</h2>
      <p>Put on a headset. Nod seriously, occasionally say: “That’s a good point, let’s circle back to that”. If someone walks in, raise your hand and whisper: “Give me a sec, I’m on a call with the Canada team”. Meanwhile, you are watching football highlights videos on mute with your small data.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">6. Your WhatsApp Bio Must Be Mysterious</h2>
      <p>Change your bio to: “Always on the move 🚀”, “Let’s collaborate 📈”, “Building empires silently 💼”. This way, no one dares ask you why you were last seen online at 3am arguing about Arsenal.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">7. Attend Every Webinar and Training Possible</h2>
      <p>They are free, they send certificates, and they make you feel productive even though you still haven’t finished season 7 of your jobless Netflix binge. Post screenshots like: “Great session on blockchain and personal branding today with professionals from 3 continents”. Yes, the 3 continents were Nigeria, Ghana, and Zoom.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Final words from a jobless professional</h2>
      <p>Look, if you're unemployed right now, you are not alone and you are not lazy. Nigeria is hard. Life is harder but while you wait for that dream job, package your silence, pose like a consultant, and keep posting quotes like: “Don’t stop until you’re proud”, even if what you’re proud of is finally washing your bedsheet after 3 weeks.</p>
