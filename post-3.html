    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mb-8">Posted on: July 2025</p>

    <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-300 text-[17px]">
      <p>If you are Nigerian and you own a phone, chances are you're in at least 12 WhatsApp groups you didn’t ask to join. One day, you’re minding your business, next thing, someone adds you to “NSPPD, Success 2030 Prayer Army or Cousins United Worldwide” and now you’re stuck forever, watching strangers fight over garri prices, politics, sin, and puff-puff distribution. These groups are not social. They are spiritual warfare in digital places.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">1. The Good Morning Ministry</h2>
      <p>It starts at 4:58 a.m. with the aunties. “Good morning blessed family 🌞🌺🌹. May your enemies fall into hot gutter today! Amen.” Then come the pictures: Animated roses spinning, Bible verses in Comic Sans, that awkward image of Jesus holding a glowing heart, and a plate of jollof for “breakfast blessings”. By 6 a.m., your phone is vibrating like its receiving deliverance.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">2. The Overzealous Evangelical Department</h2>
      <p>These ones will: Add you to 3 prayer groups without consent, send you 27 YouTube links titled “How to Reject Satan Before Breakfast” and type “Say AMEN or your phone will explode before midnight.” They operate like P.A.s to Jesus and secretaries to the Holy Spirit, constantly forwarding devotionals and scriptures that prey on your emotions. You are just trying to survive rent, now you’re being guilt-tripped because you didn't join 4 a.m. online tongues and tithe via QR code.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">3. The “Drop Something” Tension</h2>
      <p>One family group drops this bomb every month: “Let’s do contribution for Mama’s remembrance.” Contribution? Again? We just did one last week for Uncle Sunday’s birthday that he didn’t even attend. if you don’t respond within 30 minutes, they’ll start typing: “Some people in this group just dey look, but God is watching all of us.” Omo, pressure ti wa o.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">4. The Committee of Friends Trap</h2>
      <p>This one is next-level treachery. You will just wake up and find yourself added to a group called…. “Committee of Friends for Emeka & Amarachi Wedding Project 💍💒”. You have never met Emeka, Amarachi once liked your post in 2019. But now, you're expected to: Contribute ₦50,000, buy uniform Aso Ebi, attend 3 planning meetings and post motivational messages in the group so “momentum doesn’t drop”. If you dare leave the group, they’ll message you privately: “Bros abeg support love, na your own go ...

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">5. The Gossip Disguised as Prayer</h2>
      <p>“Let us pray for Sister Bisi. She is pregnant again. No husband still…” Wait. Is it prayer or premium gist? Somehow your private business ends up as “prayer request” in a 57-member group, including your primary school seatmate and two pastors from Port Harcourt.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">6. The Political Warfare</h2>
      <p>If you think Nigerian politics is messy on TV, wait till you see it on WhatsApp. Once someone types “this country is a joke” — BOOM 💥Suddenly: Your retired uncle becomes a policy analyst, Aunty Josephine starts comparing APC to Pharaoh’s Egypt, and one cousin will boldly scream: “ADC will unseat APC, mark my words”! Meanwhile, the group admin is just sipping Lipton while watching the group combust like kerosene. By nightfall: 3 people have left, 1 has been removed, and someone has posted Psalm 35 ...

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">7. The Silent Judging Society</h2>
      <p>You leave the group, boom! They add you back. You turn off notifications, someone tags you: “@Frank what’s your opinion”? You say you’re busy they say: “We all have the same 24 hours, bro”. Soon you’re the bad guy, even though all you did was protect your peace.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">8. The Occasional Terrorists</h2>
      <p>Let’s not forget the agents of chaos: The person who sends “hi” 15 times in one day, the uncle who forwards 7-minute conspiracy voice notes from 2017, that one person who posts business flyers and types “please patronize me” under every post, even if you mute the group, your mental health is not safe.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Final Words from a Group Chat Survivor</h2>
      <p>WhatsApp groups are not for the weak. They will humble you, drain you, and leave you wondering: “Who even gave these people my number”? To Meta (formerly Facebook): please include a group therapist button. We deserve compensation. And maybe a support group. Until then, keep muting, keep dodging, and remember…. “If the group no concern you, stay on read-only mode.”</p>

      <p class="italic text-sm text-gray-400">Signed, <br>A broken group member, surviving on screenshots, sarcasm, and spiritual firewall data 📱🔥🙏🏽💸</p>
