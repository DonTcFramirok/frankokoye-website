    <p>Most women bring life into the world but one notorious lady brings... malaria. Yes, we‚Äôre talking about the female Anopheles mosquito. The tiny diva of dusk who has been bothering humans for centuries. She is the kind of guest that comes uninvited, sings in your ear at midnight, and leaves a gift you didn‚Äôt ask for: a Plasmodium parasite.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Why just the females?</h2>
    <p>It is not sexism; it is pure biology. Only the female Anopheles mosquito bites humans because she needs the protein in blood to develop her eggs. The male? He just chills with nectar and vibes. Clearly not about that bloodthirsty lifestyle. So, ladies, this one is on you.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">How she operates:</h2>
    <p>She‚Äôs got stealth and speed like a Northrop B-2 bomber. She also has a built-in anesthesia dispenser. When she lands on your skin, you don‚Äôt feel a thing till she is long gone and you are scratching like DJ Johnny in Johnny‚Äôs nightclub.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">What is the big deal?</h2>
    <p>Well, her bite is more than annoying. It is the main way malaria spreads. And malaria isn‚Äôt just a bad fever, it can lead to death, especially in children and pregnant women in tropical regions.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">But here is the twist:</h2>
    <p>The female Anopheles doesn‚Äôt know she is dangerous. She is just doing mosquito mom duties, getting food for her babies. If she had a blog, she will probably write: ‚ÄúHow to prep meals using humans.‚Äù</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">What can we do?</h2>
    <p>Sleep under insecticide treated nets. Drain standing water. Use repellents. Support malaria campaigns. And if you ever hear that familiar buzz... run like you owe her money.</p>
