  <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">About Me</h2>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4">I am Frank Okoye, a dynamic professional at the intersection of data analysis and logistics. My passion is more about using digital tools to solve real world challenges, especially in public health and supply chain systems. I enjoy translating raw data into actionable insights that drive smarter decisions.</p>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4">I have served in various capacities over the years from leading logistics teams in ITN campaigns, supporting ICT4D tools such as Red Rose and Ipolongo. My career spans key projects under USAID's Global Health Supply Chain Program, where I contributed to state and zonal level distribution of health commodities, campaign reporting, field supervision, and data validation.</p>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4">I bring to every role a blend of technical skill, strategic thinking, and an eye for detail. I work confidently with tools like Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python to explore datasets, and I communicate insights effectively through reports and dashboards. My field experience also includes training facilitation, stakeholder coordination, and advocacy.</p>
  <p class="text-lg">I am committed to personal growth, continuous learning, and contributing positively to every team I join. Welcome to my digital space, a portfolio of my work, reflections, and impact.</p>
